The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by Keegan Flanagan
for sharing of python code techniques and notes.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ## [All_Depths_ORCA_Loader.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/All_Depths_ORCA_Loader.ipynb)  
    
    Hopefully, This script will allow me to load up all of the data for a given mooring and work it into one single humongous dataframe that can be used to create heat plots. 

* ## [CTD_Pickle_Loader.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/CTD_Pickle_Loader.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook Loads the Washington Department of Ecology (WADE) nutrient bottle data and matches it to the WADE CTD data and the model data. It then saves the newly created matched dataframe as a Pickle file.

* ## [Chlbot_Pickle_Loader.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/Chlbot_Pickle_Loader.ipynb)  
    
    This Script only exists as a place to load up all of the pickle files files while I am busy doing other things.

* ## [Dockton_Data_loader.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/Dockton_Data_loader.ipynb)  
    
    This script is used to extract the King County moored data from Dockton. It loads in the King County data as as a pandas dataframe from an excel file. These excel files are not organized to work as Pandas dataframes, so a significant amount of cleaning is necessary. Several additional variables have been calculated from the data to assist in matching this data to the SalishSeaCast model output. 

* ## [ORCA_Loader-Copy1.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/ORCA_Loader-Copy1.ipynb)  
    
    This script loads and fixes up the moored data from the ORCA Buoys. PLEASE NOTE: this script has essentially been left in an unfinished state due to a change in workflow. All processing in of the ORCA data now happens in the analysis notebooks themselves. 

* ## [Phytoplankton_Data_Loader.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/Phytoplankton_Data_Loader.ipynb)  
    
    Hopefully, This script will allow me to load up and fix up the moored data

* ## [PointWilliams_Data_Loader.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/PointWilliams_Data_Loader.ipynb)  
    
    This script is used to extract the King County moored data from PointWilliams. It loads in the King County data as a pandas dataframe from an excel file. These excel files are not organized to work as Pandas dataframes, so a significant amount of cleaning is necessary. Several additional variables have been calculated from the data to assist in matching this data to the SalishSeaCast model output. 

* ## [WADE_Pickle_Loader.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/WADE_Pickle_Loader.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook Loads the Washington Department of Ecology (WADE) nutrient bottle data and matches it to the WADE CTD data and the model data. It then saves the newly created matched dataframe as a Pickle file.

* ## [nutchl_pickle_loader.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Pickle_File_Makers/nutchl_pickle_loader.ipynb)
