The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by Keegan Flanagan
for sharing of python code techniques and notes.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ## [By_Region.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/By_Region.ipynb)  
    
    This script contains a variety of scatter plots in order to show the correlation between model data and observational and how environmental variables can effect the error of the model data. It also contains many tables which list the bias, root mean square error, and Wilmot skill score of model-observational comparisons of various variables. (Note too self, the ability to generate a map for a specific area with colour coded stations that are equivalent to the graphs would be good.) 

* ## [CTD_By_Year.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/CTD_By_Year.ipynb)  
    
    This script looks at the relationship between model and observed values of temperature and Salinity within Puget Sound. It is made so that multiple years can be viewed at once. 

* ## [CTD_Nutrients_By_Year.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/CTD_Nutrients_By_Year.ipynb)  
    
    This script contains two sections. The frist is a series of scatter plots that show how environmental variables can effect the error of the model data. The second is a series of scatter plots that show correlation between model data and observational data. This script is made so that you can easily view multiple years at once.

* ## [Time_Series_evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Time_Series_evaluation.ipynb)  
    
* ## [Untitled.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Untitled.ipynb)
