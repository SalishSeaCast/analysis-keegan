The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by Keegan Flanagan

* ## [CTD_all_years_summary.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/All_Years_Summaries/CTD_all_years_summary.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains an evaluation of the SalishSeaCast model within PugetSound using all of the Washington Department of Ecology CTD data collected between 2007 and 2019. More specifically, it takes observed temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll concentrations collected by a CTD and compares them to the model output. This evaluation includes scatter plots and 2d histograms visualizing the similarity of observed and model data as well as tables of evaluation statistics. 

* ## [Chlbot_all_years_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/All_Years_Summaries/Chlbot_all_years_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    A summary notebook which contains an evaluation of the SalishSeaCast model within PugetSound using all of the Washington Department of Ecology chlorophyll bottle data collected between 2007 and 2019. More specifically, it compares Observed data on chlorophyll concentrations collected using bottle samples and compares it to various model phytoplankon outputs. It also looks at temperature and salinity data collected from CTD data and compares model error to these environmental variables. This evaluation includes scatter plots visualizing the similarity of observed and model data as well as tables of evaluation statistics.

* ## [Time_Series_evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/All_Years_Summaries/Time_Series_evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    This script contains timeseries diagrams that show how the data changes over all of the sample years for multiple depths.

* ## [WADE_all_year_summary.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/All_Years_Summaries/WADE_all_year_summary.ipynb)  
    
    A summary notebook which contains an evaluation of the SalishSeaCast model within PugetSound using all of the Washington Department of Ecology nutrient bottle data collected between 2007 and 2019. More specifically, it compares observed data on various nutrient concentrations collected using bottle samples and compares it to model outputs. It also looks at temperature and salinity data collected from CTD data and compares model error to these environmental variables. This evaluation includes scatter plots and 2d histograms visualizing the similarity of observed and model data as well as tables of evaluation statistics.
