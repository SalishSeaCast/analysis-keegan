* ## [2007_Timeseries_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Timeseries_Individual_Years/2007_Timeseries_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains timeseries of SalishSeaCast model output and observed data within PugetSound for the year 2009. This script is designed so that changes the the observed and model data over time can be easily compared.

* ## [2008_Timeseries_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Timeseries_Individual_Years/2008_Timeseries_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains timeseries of SalishSeaCast model output and observed data within PugetSound for the year 2009. This script is designed so that changes the the observed and model data over time can be easily compared.

* ## [2009_Time_Series_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Timeseries_Individual_Years/2009_Time_Series_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    This script is meant to contain a bunch of timeseries diagrams that show how certain variables are changing over time. At the moment it is very messy due to some... experimentation with the best way to protry these time series given the disperse sampling time of the Wade and CTD data. Hopefully, we can acquire some moore data that will allow for the formation of more detailed timeseries. This notebook will allow for multiple years to e viewed easily.
