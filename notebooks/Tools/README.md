* ## [full_model_timeseries.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Tools/full_model_timeseries.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook contains a prototype for a workflow that would allow you to compare observations that were sampled in dicrete time to the model output in continuous time. Only the first 14 cells work, and even then they are so unbelievably slow as to be almost entirely useless.
