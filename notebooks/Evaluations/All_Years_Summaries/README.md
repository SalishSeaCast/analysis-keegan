* ## [Chlbot_all_years_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/All_Years_Summaries/Chlbot_all_years_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains an evaluation of the SalishSeaCast model within PugetSound for the year 2009. More specifically, it compares Observed data on chlorophyll concentrations collected from bottle data and compares it to various model phytoplankon outputs. This evaluation includes scatter plots visualizing the similarity of observed and model data as well as tables of evaluation statistics.

* ## [Time_Series_evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/All_Years_Summaries/Time_Series_evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    This script is meant to contain a bunch of timeseries diagrams that show how certain variables are changing over time. This notebook allows for multiple years to e viewed easily. 

* ## [WADE_all_year_summary.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/All_Years_Summaries/WADE_all_year_summary.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which will contain plots showing data summaries for every year combined.
