The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by Keegan Flanagan
for sharing of python code techniques and notes.

## Warning!! This notebook folder consists unfinished work!
This folder was meant to contain a sereis of notebooks that would allow model-observation comparisons for different years to be easily used. However, as the project continued the need for these notebooks became less and less of a priority. I eventually decided to leave these notebooks unfinished to focus on other things. The unfinished notebooks have been left here in case their contents are of use to future projects. 

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ## [CTD_By_Year.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/By_Year_Evaluations/CTD_By_Year.ipynb)  
    
    This script looks at the relationship between model and observed values of temperature and Salinity within Puget Sound. It is made so that multiple years can be viewed at once. 

* ## [CTD_Nutrients_By_Year.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/By_Year_Evaluations/CTD_Nutrients_By_Year.ipynb)  
    
    This script contains two sections. The frist is a series of scatter plots that show how environmental variables can effect the error of the model data. The second is a series of scatter plots that show correlation between model data and observational data. This script is made so that you can easily view multiple years at once.

* ## [Timeseries_By_Year.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/By_Year_Evaluations/Timeseries_By_Year.ipynb)  
    
    This script is meant to contain a bunch of timeseries diagrams that show how certain variables are changing over time. This notebook allows for multiple years to be viewed easily.
