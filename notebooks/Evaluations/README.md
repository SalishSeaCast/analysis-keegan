The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by Keegan Flanagan
for sharing of python code techniques and notes.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ## [CTD_Base_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/CTD_Base_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains an evaluation of the SalishSeaCast model within PugetSound. More specifically, it compares Observed data on temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll concentrations  collected from CTD data and compares it to various model phytoplankon outputs. This evaluation includes scatter plots and 2d histograms visualizing the similarity of observed and model data as well as tables of evaluation statistics. 

* ## [Chlbot_Base_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Chlbot_Base_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains an evaluation of the SalishSeaCast model within PugetSound. More specifically, it compares Observed data on chlorophyll concentrations collected from bottle data and compares it to various model phytoplankon outputs. This evaluation includes scatter plots visualizing the similarity of observed and model data as well as tables of evaluation statistics.

* ## [Ind_Stations_Timeseries_Base.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Ind_Stations_Timeseries_Base.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains timeseries of SalishSeaCast model output and observed data within PugetSound. This script is designed so that model and observed data can be easily compared across multiple different stations. 

* ## [Timeseries_Base_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Timeseries_Base_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains timeseries of SalishSeaCast model output and observed data within PugetSound. This script is designed so that changes the the observed and model data over time can be easily compared.

* ## [WADE_Base_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/WADE_Base_Puget_Evaluation.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook which contains an evaluation of the SalishSeaCast model within PugetSound. More specifically, it compares observed data on various nutrient concentrations collected from bottle data and compares it to model outputs. It also looks at temperature and salinity data collected from CTD data and compares model error to these environmental variables. This evaluation includes scatter plots and 2d histograms visualizing the similarity of observed and model data as well as tables of evaluation statistics.
