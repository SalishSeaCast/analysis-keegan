The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by Keegan Flanagan
for sharing of python code techniques and notes.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ## [Puget_Thalweg_Plotting.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Thalweg_work/Puget_Thalweg_Plotting.ipynb)  
    
    This script contains thalweg plots for Puget sound for a thalweg drawn through adrimarlty inlet to Main basin. These thalweg plots show how several model variables change along the thalwegs such as salinity and temperature.

* ## [Thalweg Smoothing.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Thalweg_work/Thalweg Smoothing.ipynb)  
    
    Smooth the Thalweg

* ## [Thalweg Work.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Thalweg_work/Thalweg Work.ipynb)  
    
    Determine the Thalweg in more Detail and Channelize it

* ## [compute_thalweg.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-keegan/blob/master/notebooks/Evaluations/Thalweg_work/compute_thalweg.ipynb)  
    
    This script contains code that computes a rough thalweg through an area. I hope to eventually implement a second set of code that smooths out the created thalweg and saves itas a textfile.
